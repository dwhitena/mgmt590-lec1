I have made changes to the exsisting model and have added a new model as well. The output is data frame with 2 new columns which allows the user
to directly compare the output of both the models. The rationale behind doing so is a simple thought that no one particular model can always guarantee
sucess given the diverse nature of the input data. Thus, the data should be processed through different model and the one giving a better accuracy should
be selected.
